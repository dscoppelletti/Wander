    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=93:C0:0A:CB:36:3F:03:B6:08:8A:38:F3:26:54:74:E4:CE:EA:0B:60%3Bcom.example.android.wander

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    93:C0:0A:CB:36:3F:03:B6:08:8A:38:F3:26:54:74:E4:CE:EA:0B:60

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    93:C0:0A:CB:36:3F:03:B6:08:8A:38:F3:26:54:74:E4:CE:EA:0B:60

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <!-- DOC STEP 1.1 - Create the Wander project with the Maps template
    You use this configuration file to hold your API key. The template generates
    two google_maps_api.xml files: one for debug and one for release. The file
    for the API key for the debug certificate is located in
    src/debug/res/values. The file for the API key for the release certificate
    is located in src/release/res/values. In this practical we only use the
    debug certificate.
    DOC END STEP 1.1. -->
    <!-- TODO STEP 1.2 - Obtain the API key
    I am used to keep my API keys in a safer place.
